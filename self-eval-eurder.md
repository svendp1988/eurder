# Örder self-checker
Örder is not only an awesome order management application, it is also a great self-evaluation, done by our best junior java developers.
The goal is not to "get it over with", the goal is to learn & grow:
 - Do I grasp the concepts?
 - Which topics do I get? Where can I challenge myself to go the extra mile?
 - Where do I struggle? Which topics should I work on?
 - Do codereviews on your own code. Make it work + improve and refine it. (for inspiration, look at https://switchfully.slack.com/files/UK99TQ0G6/F0100872XJA/codereview.pdf)
## Which choices did you make in your project
As a developer you have to make choices constantly.
Choices about time efficiency and quality, choices about your architecture, choices about functionality.
Which choices did you make? (List your choices below, remove what is not relevant)
 - What is your focus when working on Örder?
 > My focus lies in trying to write clean, consistent code and trying to test as much as possible. 
 > For the moment I'm not doing it test first since I notice that there are still a lot of concepts in testing (mocking, stubbing, integrationtests, testing webclients) that I don't understand and therefor cannot use.
 > I notice that I still have the habit of overcomplicating things. I'll get an idea in my head and can get completely carried away with that. Sometimes this leads to me losing track of what I'm doing.
 - Do you have a single-module maven project? Or a multi-module maven project?
 > I have created a multi-module maven project. I think that I understand maven well enough, plus I know my way around tutorials to help me figure it out.
 - Are you working test-first?
 > For the unit tests I really try to do this. When I get feedback about my code though and start altering things I lose track of writing tests first because I want to get the quality of my code up.
 > There are a couple of concepts that I really don't understand well enough and need extra attention. These include mocking, stubbing and testing webclients.
 - Do you have security enabled?
 > Yes, I have copied the security we implemented on the digibooky project. I don't really understand everything yet and am completely unable to test my security.
 - Do you have logging enabled?
 > Yes, also copied from the digibooky project. I understand this well enough to know what's happening.
 - What happens if the firstname contains numbers? Is this allowed?
 > For the moment it is. I haven't really been able to focus on the edge-cases yet, I have some other priorities I want to focus on first.
 - In which currency are the prices?
 > My prices currently don't have a currency. This is something I want to focus on later.
 - Does the phonenumber include the country code?
 > Same answer as for the previous question.
 - Did you go for a similar architecture as digibooky?
 > Yes, I don't think I have made any major changes to the architecture we used there. I do think that (if I manage to finish this) I will have a second look at the architecture.
 - Is your application deployed in the cloud? (Heroku?)
 > Yes, though I didn't figure this out on my own.
